1. What have you been doing for the last six months (or the last year)?
The client already has your resume. He wants to hear you talk about your activities, 
the technical aspects of your last position(s), whether you prefer to work alone or are a team player, 
how you handle pressure and deadlines, etc. and he wants to see how you handle yourself. Be prepared to spend a few minutes discussing your assignment(s) for the last year or two. Respond with specific details and examples; avoid abrupt "yes " or "no " answers.
2. Why did you leave (do you want to leave) your last position?
If you left for a reason other than completion of the project, state your reasons honestly and simply. 
Do not give a long, detailed answer on the "wrongs " you found at the job.
3. What are your strengths? Weaknesses?
The ability to talk about your strengths is an indication of self-confidence. 
As for your weaknesses, it is probably accurate to say that none have been 
called to your attention that would prevent you from doing a good job in the position under consideration.
4. Tell me about yourself.
Before you answer, you can ask, "Which part of my experience would you like me to start with? 
" Then give a two-minute response that shows you to be a positive, enthusiastic person who can be of value to their company.
BE POISED, BE INTERESTED, BE DECISIVE, BE MODEST
